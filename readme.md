This project attempts to implement the Shortest Process Next Scheduling Algorithm using Linear Regression.
Features of the stats of a variety of processes will be fed into the model, in which the model should attempt to predict the runtime of the process.

Once the model has figured out the proper weights and bias' we will be able to feed in a new process, and the model wil store the predicted runtime of the process.

Once all of these are stored, we effectivley can figure out which process can run next, as we have the preodcted runtimes of all processes!
